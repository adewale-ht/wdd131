            <h2>Project Subject</h2>
            <strong>Subject:</strong> Nigerian Temples and Interactive AI Chat<br>
            <strong>Description:</strong>
            This website will feature information about various temples in Nigeria, including their history, images, and cultural importance. It will also include an interactive AI Chat page that demonstrates advanced JavaScript features and user engagement. The site will have at least four pages: a home page introducing the topic, a gallery page with optimized images and facts, a temples page with detailed information, and an AI Chat page. There will also be a references page for citations. The site will use a common navigation and theme, be fully responsive, and include dynamic JavaScript features such as weather info, interactive elements, and localStorage usage.<br>
            <strong>Reason:</strong>
            I chose this subject because I am passionate about sharing the rich heritage and spiritual significance of Nigerian temples, and I want to showcase my skills in web development by building an engaging AI Chat experience. My goal is to educate and inspire others about cultural value, while demonstrating proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
